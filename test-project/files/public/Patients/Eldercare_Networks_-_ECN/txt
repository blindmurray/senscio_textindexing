US Consulate General in Shanghai
1469 Huai Hai Zhong Road
Shanghai, China, 200031

Dear Consul,

I would like to invite my brother Mr. Dongming Xia (Chinese passport E01530347) and 
his wife Ms. Weihong Zhu (Chinese passport E01529494) to have a short visit to the 
United States this summer. My brother is an entrepreneur and owns a company called 
Zhejiang Seeco Media Ltd. 

If the visa is granted, they will most likely enter the US at the beginning of August, and 
return to China around August 21st. Their visit to the United States has two purposes: 
first, their son (my nephew) Mr. Bowen Xia is accepted as a freshman at Penn State 
University and will start the school year around August 15th; and second, they will tour 
the east part of the US for couple of weeks. During their stay in the US, they will mostly 
live with my family at the above address in Massachusetts. 

My brother and his wife have visited other countries in Europe, and his wife has visited 
the US several years ago. 

Therefore, I will be most grateful if you could grant them necessary visa so they could 
come to visit me this summer. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have any 
questions.

Thanks a lot in advance!

Sincerely yours,

Donglu Xia
